# Assets Folder

This folder contains placeholder references for app assets.

## Required Assets

The following assets are referenced in `app.json` and should be replaced with actual images:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `splash-icon.png` - Splash screen icon
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon

## Note

These are placeholders. For production, replace with your own branded assets.
The app will work without these files in development mode.
